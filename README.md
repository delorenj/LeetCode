# 🚀 Welcome to My LeetCode Sandbox! 🚀

## 🧠 What's this all about?

This is where I practice stuff and learn things and occasionally learn stuff and things. 😅

## 🗂 Repository Structure

## 🐍 Current Languages

- **Python**: Because apparently everyone uses it now and I can't just continue avoiding it for no apparent reason other than I just decided one day like 15 years ago to not like it. 🐍

## 🔮 Future Plans

I'm planning to add more languages as the need comes up. Maybe Go? Rust? ? Who knows! 🤷‍♂️

## 💡 Why LeetCode?

1. To keep my brain squishy and fresh 🧠
2. To occasionally remind myself that my college loan debt is money well spent 🐱‍💻
3. To add some structure to my life-long, continuous learning journey 📚

## 🤓 Fun Fact

If you stack all the unmatched socks in the world end-to-end, they would stretch to the moon and back 0.00001 times. 🧦🌕
